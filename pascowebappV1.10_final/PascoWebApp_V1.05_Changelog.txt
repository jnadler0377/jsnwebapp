Pasco Web App — Version 1.05 (November 2025)
Status: Active Production Build
Archived Versions: v1.00 → v1.03

------------------------------------------------------------
Major Additions
------------------------------------------------------------
- Checkbox Selection + Bulk Actions
  • Added case-selection checkboxes on cases_list.html.
  • New Export to CSV and Archive Selected buttons.
  • CSV export now correctly pulls checked rows only.

- Pagination & Display
  • Page-count and navigation buttons reduced by ≈ 50% in size.
  • Font size on case list reduced to ~75% for compact layout.
  • Address formatting switched to Title Case for readability.

- UI Refinements
  • Address moved directly under the case number in details view.
  • “Address (Override)” → “Address” label change.
  • “Edit Address Override” → “Edit” button label.
  • “Open in Property Appraiser,” “Style,” “Division,” and “Judge” removed for a cleaner display.
  • File-upload blocks (“Verified Complaint,” “Value Calculation,” “Mortgage”) now appear as single-line items.

- Internal Behavior Fixes
  • Export CSV no longer triggers the “Update Cases” routine.
  • Archive function now removes cases from the visible list immediately.
  • Spinner state corrected so “Update Cases” and “Export CSV” act independently.
  • Logging expanded in main.py for error tracing (debug_update_cases.log).

------------------------------------------------------------
Backend & Code Adjustments
------------------------------------------------------------
- Consolidated logging configuration.
- Added asyncio event-loop patch for Windows compatibility.
- Refactored FastAPI routes for file upload endpoints to avoid {"detail": "Not Found"} errors.
- Pagination, filtering, and database queries optimized for SQLite (foreclosure.db).

------------------------------------------------------------
Next Planned Updates (v1.06 target)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Add bulk-note entry and multi-case tagging.
- Include download CSV of archived cases.
- Optional user-auth or session persistence for multi-user environments.
- UI polish: progress bar styling, consistent font sizing, dark-mode option.
